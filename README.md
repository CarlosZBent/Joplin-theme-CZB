# Joplin-theme-CZB
A minimal theme to be applied to Joplin using custom CSS files. It doesn't go too far from the official design, just adding some nicer lines and angles.

## Usage
[This post](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/introduction-to-customising-joplin-userchrome-css-userstyle-css/21370) covers pretty much everything needed to customize your Joplin with CSS.

Simply locate the Joplin folder under `~/.config/joplin-desktop` for Linux systems and `C:\users\<username>\.config\joplin-desktop` on Windows systems and paste the files from this repo. Or access the CSS files from inside the app by going to Settings > Appearance > Show Advanced Settings and pressing "Custom stylesheet for rendered Markdown" (which opens userstyle.css) or "Custom stylesheet for Joplin-wide settings" (which opens userchrome.css), and paste the contents of this files inside those.

It's a good idea to access the files from the app the first time you are gonna do this, so the app itself generates the files.
